# Logistic_Regression_Music_Classifier
Music classifier was developed with Gradient descent &amp;  Logistic Regression implementation and Music files are categorized in to different genres.  Music file frequency intensities are obtained as features using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients(MFCC) with which the Music files are classified.


Requirements:
=============

1. Matlab installed PC, Latest version would be better.

2. Pc or Laptop with 6 GB RAM or more is advisable for running the program(since I observed 4.5GB of RAM resources is taken for my project execution)


Simulation Procedure:
=====================

1. Copy the Project3.m file provided in the zip file to a location in your PC and open the file in matlab.

2. Give correct input file locations in the lines 9,11 that is folder generes are placed in your laptop.

2. Now click on the file opened and you can see the Run button on the Editor tab on the top row of the application  
   which has to be clicked for file execution.

3. Please unzip the mfcc folder attached in the folder, then load the mfcc.m file in matlab and run the mfcc.m file
   since if any funtions are used in matlab main program, funtion file should be first run before the project file.

4. Now you can see a Matlab editor window  opened , then click Add to path for the program to run.

5. The results values will be displayed in the Matlab workspace.

6. Observe the accuracies using FFT, 20 features of FFT, MFCC methods named with fianl(method)accuracy names-methods corresponds to fft,feature,MFCC

7. Observe the confusion matrix generated for each methods fft, 20 feature fft, MFCC
